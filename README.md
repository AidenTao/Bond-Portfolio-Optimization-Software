# Bond-Portfolio-Optimization-Software
1.Each input file has various bonds with different maturity and coupon payments and I suppose that we have a year-10 ob;igation of $1790.85.
2.I can compute the YTM, duration and convexity for each cash flows.
3.Assuming no changes in term structure, compute the percentage of face value of each cash flow I will have to purchase to meet the future debt obligation.
4.I should pick the bond-portfolio that will meet the required obligation when it is due, and has the largest convexity among all possible portfolio choices. I will regard this as a Linear Programming Problem and use lp_solve to find optimal answers.
