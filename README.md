# Bond-Portfolio-Optimization-Software
1.Each input file has various bonds with different maturities and coupon payments but same face value and I suppose that I have a year-10 obligation of $1790.85. According to the data, I can compute the YTM, duration and convexity for each cash flows. Assuming no changes in term structure, I need to compute the percentage of face value of each cash flow I will have to purchase to meet the future debt obligation. More importantly, I should pick the bond-portfolio that will meet the required obligation when it is due, and has the largest convexity among all possible portfolio choices. I will regard this as a Linear Programming Problem and use lp_solve to find optimal answers.
